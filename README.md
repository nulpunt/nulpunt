================================

This repository contains the server and the static web files (html,css,js) for Nulpunt

For more information about Nulpunt, please visit [nulpunt.nu](http://nulpunt.nu)

### Closed repo
The development of this application is closed fow now. If you know someone that wants to join, please ask an Owner ([GeertJohan](mailto:gjr19912@gmail.com)) to add this person to the "Contributors" team.

### Development
Please view the [issues](https://github.com/nulpunt/nulpunt/issues?state=open) on this repo. If you have an idea or suggestion, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/nulpunt/nulpunt/issues/new).

If you want to create something new, make sure the idea was approved by a nulpunt maintainer. It would be sad to have development time spilled on duplicates or features that won't be merged in.

### Dependencies
This project uses several third-party dependencies. Such as the `mgo` driver for MongoDB.
These dependencies (third-party packages) are to be imported by nulpunt code as local imports.
This has several important advantages over the normal go import system (`GOPATH`/`go get`):
- Third-party code is checked and managed within the same repo as the application code. A commit can always refer to the right version, because it is included in the commit (local).
- New third-party code must go through a PR, and can easily be checked.
- Project will still build when remote dependency is unreachable or removed.

Some cons:
- Depencencies must be updated manually
- Can't use the go tool as much, more manual work

If anyone can point to or provide a better way to do this, please open an issue.
